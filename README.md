# Geometry_notes.tex

Creating a La Tex document to keep track of Geometry notes handwritten in class.  
I started this project while I was an aid to Mr. Garretson during covid in 2021.
I never finished and so now I am picking it up again. 
LaTex creates math documents that look professional. 
This project combines rewriting geometry paper notes and refining how to efficiently code them into LaTex.
If the notes can be completed daily and accurately I would consider sharing them. But this is purely a LaTex learning exercise for me.

This has led me to overleaf an online LaTex editor. Geogebra an online math creating tool.  Texmaker a linux latex editing tool. It works ok.

Some writers use vim or neovim to edit LaTex I haven't got that figured out at this time.
Emacs OrgMode can do it.

So I am looking at those methods.

I am struggling with the setup of Neovim.
